# Fake News Detection Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a data analysis project focused on detecting fake news. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify news articles as either real or fake based on various features extracted from the text.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Fake News Dataset from Kaggle, which contains news articles labeled as either real or fake. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/fake-news-detection).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Data Cleaning
1. Merge different news
2. Check for null values
3. Convert the labels for real and fake news
4. Remove stopwords

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1. What is the length of text in either fake or real news?
2. What is the number of sentences in either fake or real news?
3. Which type of news has the highest number of stopwrods?
4.  What is the average number of words per sentences in either fake or real news?
